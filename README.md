# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-using-Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forests
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers. 

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
- Filename: titanic.csv
- Target Variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python3, Pandas, NumPy,Scikit-learn,Matplotlib, Seaborn,Graphviz

## ✅ What I Did
- Loaded and cleaned the Titanic dataset (titanic.csv).
- Encoded categorical variables and handled missing values.
- Built two models:
1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. Random Forest Classifier
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Trained models and made predictions.
- Controlled overfitting by tuning tree depth.
- Compared accuracy of Decision Tree and Random Forest.
- Evaluated models using cross-validation.
- Analyzed feature importances from the Random Forest.
- Visualized:
1) Decision Tree structure
2) Accuracy vs Tree Depth
- Feature importances
